## 👋 Hi there I am Chong Fai Jason Wong!!

Welcome to my GitHub 😀! 
I’m a machine learning developer passionate about building real-time, intelligent systems that bridge perception and action, from sign language interpreters to gameplay analytics agents.

🎓 Currently wrapping up my **Master of Artificial Intelligence** at UTS (🏅 Dean’s List 2024 & 2025), with a background in **Electronics & Computer Engineering** from HKUST.

🧠 By day, I’ve worked across cloud architecture and AI research — and by night, I break models (intentionally).
